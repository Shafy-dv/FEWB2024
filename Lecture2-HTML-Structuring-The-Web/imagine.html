<h1>Imagine</h1>

<p>Imagine there's no heaven<br>
It's easy if you try<br>
No hell below us<br>
Above us only sky<br>
Imagine all the people<br>
Living for today... Aha-ah...</p>

<p>Imagine there's no countries<br>
It isn't hard to do<br>
Nothing to kill or die for<br>
And no religion, too<br>
Imagine all the people<br>
Living life in peace... You...</p>

<p>You may say I'm a dreamer<br>
But I'm not the only one<br>
I hope someday you'll join us<br>
And the world will be as one</p>

<p>Imagine no possessions<br>
I wonder if you can<br>
No need for greed or hunger<br>
A brotherhood of man<br>
Imagine all the people<br>
Sharing all the world... You...</p>

<p>You may say I'm a dreamer<br>
But I'm not the only one<br>
I hope someday you'll join us<br>
And the world will live as one</p>
